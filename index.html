<p>Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Sorry, Data. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody.</p>

<p>Ensign Babyface! Talk about going nowhere fast. We have a saboteur aboard. Not if I weaken first. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Travel time to the nearest starbase?</p>

<p>Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. I'll be sure to note that in my log. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. I'll alert the crew. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz.</p>

<p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.</p>

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>I am a CS grad student and professional researcher interested in machine learning and neural computation.  In my current research, I develop simulations of the neural circuitry comprising the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex.  I work alongside chemical sensing specialists to develop novel algorithms and apply these methods in artificial olfactory systems. In the past I have also worked on fluid dynamics simulations, laboratory automation systems, mobile applications and a computational model of visual cognition and attention.</p>
