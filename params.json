{"name":"Michael Walton","tagline":"Neural computation researcher, software engineer, campy sci-fi writer","body":"## [Artificial Olfaction](https://github.com/mwalton/artificial-olfaction)\r\nAs a research scientist at Evolved Machines, I work with a diverse team of engineers, physicists and chemists to develop novel VOC sensing and identification systems inspired by the structure of the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex.  My current research projects involve the systematic development of experiments to answer the question: “How do neural circuits in the mammalian olfactory system achieve sensitivity and specificity far greater than the best machine learning algorithms?”.\r\n\r\n## [Chemical Sensing Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCz2-k84q8)\r\nOur research is supported by a multitude of VOC sensing technologies including Metal Oxide Gas (MOX) sensors, colormetric sensor array (CSA) technology as well as chemo-resistive DNA functionalized carbon nanotube field effect transistor (cntFET) arrays. However many of these technologies are currently under development; Therefore, in order to carry out research on the classification algorithms implemented in biological neural networks, we have developed a novel fluid simulation environment and sensor model capable of generating simulated datasets designed to replicated the behaviors of a cntFET sensor in a passive gas sensing experiment in a turbulent environment.\r\n\r\n### Demos (YouTube):\r\n[Sensor Array](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCCz2-k84q8)  \r\n[Olfactory Spectrogram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCCe88OMpA8)  \r\n\r\n## [ArrowNav](https://github.com/mwalton/arrow-nav)\r\nAs a final project for Human Computer Interaction, I co-developed a novel Android turn-by-turn navigation application designed to minimize driver distraction. I also developed an android wrapper API to the MapQuest Open guidance services JSON API in support of this project. The system was developed using iterative design methods and tested in a usability testing study.\r\n\r\n## EPIC Covert Attention Module\r\nIn support of experiments involving Cognitive Load theory of attention in the context of a distracted driving task, I devloped a novel covert visual attention system using saliency maps.\r\n\r\n## About Me\r\nI am a CS grad student and professional researcher interested in machine learning and neural computation.  In my current research, I develop simulations of the neural circuitry comprising the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex.  I work alongside chemical sensing specialists to develop novel algorithms and apply these methods in artificial olfactory systems. In the past I have also worked on fluid dynamics simulations, laboratory automation systems, mobile applications and a computational model of visual cognition and attention.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
